# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🔨 Critical Rule - New Rule Addition Process

When receiving instructions from users that appear to require continuous application rather than one-time handling:

1. Ask "Should this be made a standard rule?"
2. If YES is received, add it as an additional rule to CLAUDE.md
3. Apply it as a standard rule thereafter

This process enables continuous improvement of project rules.

## Essential Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Clean and build everything
./gradlew clean build

# Build and install debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew installDebug

# iOS development
open iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests (same as CI)
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

# Run all tests with coverage
./gradlew test

# Run tests for specific platforms
./gradlew iosSimulatorArm64Test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Run lint analysis
./gradlew lint

# Fix lint issues automatically
./gradlew lintFix
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a **Kotlin Multiplatform** project using **Compose Multiplatform** with a **clean architecture** pattern:

### Three-Layer Architecture
- **Presentation Layer** (`presentation/`): MVVM pattern with Compose UI, ViewModels, and reactive state management
- **Domain Layer** (`domain/`): Pure business logic with Use Cases, Entities (Habit, Task, HabitLog), and Repository interfaces
- **Data Layer** (`data/`): Repository implementations, Room database, and data mappers

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Habit vs Task Distinction:**
- **Habit**: Template/rule defining what should be done (e.g., "Drink water every hour")
- **Task**: Specific instance scheduled for a particular time (e.g., "Drink water at 10:00 AM on 2024-01-20")

**Dependency Injection (Koin):**
- Each layer has its own module: `PresentationModule`, `DomainModule`, `DataModule`
- Platform-specific modules use `expect/actual` pattern for Android/iOS implementations

**Repository Pattern:**
- `HabitRepository` interface in domain layer
- `HabitRepositoryImpl` in data layer using Room database
- Reactive data streams with Kotlin Flow

### Notification System
- **Sequential Scheduling**: One notification scheduled per habit, chain-scheduled after each trigger
- **Platform Implementations**: 
  - Android: `AlarmManager` + `BroadcastReceiver`
  - iOS: `UserNotifications` framework
- **Dynamic Content**: Notifications fetch current habit data at scheduling time

## Critical Coding Standards

### Logging Requirements
**All catch blocks must include exception logging:**
```kotlin
try {
    // operation
} catch (e: Exception) {
    Logger.e(e, "Failed to perform operation", tag = "ComponentName")
    // handle exception
}
```

**Import the project Logger:**
```kotlin
import com.nagopy.kmp.habittracker.util.Logger
```

**Use meaningful tags:**
```kotlin
Logger.d("Creating habit: ${habit.name}", tag = "HabitCreation")
```

### Documentation Requirements
**Always read `/docs` directory first** - it contains:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Complete system design and patterns
- `CODING_STANDARDS.md`: Logging and exception handling requirements  
- `SPECIFICATIONS.md`: Screen specifications and UI requirements

**Update documentation when making changes** - keep `/docs` synchronized with code modifications.

### Communication Guidelines
- **Japanese** for PR titles, descriptions, and review comments
- **English** for code, code comments, and technical documentation

## Key Technology Stack
- **UI**: Compose Multiplatform with Material Design 3
- **Database**: Room with KSP code generation
- **DI**: Koin dependency injection
- **Testing**: JUnit, MockK, kotlin-test, kotlinx-coroutines-test
- **Logging**: Napier (project Logger wrapper)
- **Date/Time**: kotlinx.datetime

## Platform Targets
- **Android**: Min SDK 24, Target SDK 34, JVM 11
- **iOS**: iosX64, iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64 with static framework
