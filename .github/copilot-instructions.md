# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Essential First Step

Before answering any questions about this project or generating code, **always read the documentation in the `/docs` directory first**. This directory contains comprehensive and up-to-date information about:

- **Project Architecture** (`/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`): Complete system design, layer responsibilities, dependency injection patterns, and technical implementation details
- **Coding Standards** (`/docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`): Logging guidelines, exception handling requirements, and code quality standards
- **Feature Specifications** (`/docs/SPECIFICATIONS.md`): Detailed screen specifications, UI components, user interactions, and business logic

## Project Context

This is a cross-platform habit tracking application built with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform. All project-specific information including:

- Build and test commands
- Development environment setup
- Technical architecture and design patterns
- Coding conventions and standards
- Feature requirements and specifications

...is maintained in the `/docs` directory to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Guidelines

1. **Always reference `/docs` first** before providing any code suggestions or architectural advice
2. **Follow the established patterns** documented in the architecture and coding standards
3. **Maintain consistency** with existing code structure and naming conventions as documented in the coding standards
4. **Refer to specifications** when implementing UI components or business logic

## Communication Guidelines

When creating PR titles, descriptions, and comments for reviewers:

- **Use Japanese** for all PR-related content (titles, descriptions, review comments) to ensure clear communication with project maintainers
- **Use English** for code, comments within code, and technical documentation
- **Follow established terminology** and conventions used in existing Japanese documentation

The `/docs` directory serves as the single source of truth for all project information.
