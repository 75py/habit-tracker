# iOS Swipe Back Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of iOS swipe back functionality in the Habit Tracker app using Compose Multiplatform.

## Problem Statement

iOS users expect to be able to swipe from the left edge of the screen to navigate back to the previous screen, similar to the native iOS experience. This feature was not available in the original Compose Multiplatform implementation.

## Solution Architecture

### Cross-Platform Interface

The implementation uses the `expect/actual` pattern to provide platform-specific implementations:

```kotlin
// Common interface (SwipeBackHandler.kt)
@Composable
expect fun SwipeBackHandler(
    enabled: Boolean = true,
    onSwipeBack: () -> Unit,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
)
```

### Platform Implementations

#### iOS Implementation (`SwipeBackHandler.ios.kt`)

- **Gesture Detection Area**: Creates a 20dp-wide invisible strip on the left edge of the screen
- **Gesture Recognition**: Uses `detectDragGestures` to detect rightward swipes
- **Trigger Threshold**: 30dp minimum swipe distance to trigger navigation
- **Callback Integration**: Integrates with existing `safeNavigateBack()` function

**Key Features:**
- Prevents accidental triggers with distance threshold
- Provides debug logging for gesture tracking
- Uses debouncing to prevent multiple rapid triggers
- Only responds to rightward swipes from the left edge

#### Android Implementation (`SwipeBackHandler.android.kt`)

- **System Integration**: Defers to Android's system gesture navigation
- **Simple Passthrough**: Simply renders content without additional gesture handling
- **Consistency**: Maintains same interface for cross-platform usage

## Integration Points

### Navigation Integration

The SwipeBackHandler is integrated into the main navigation screens:

```kotlin
SwipeBackHandler(
    enabled = true,
    onSwipeBack = { safeNavigateBack() }
) {
    HabitEditScreen(/* ... */)
}
```

### Enabled Screens

- **Add Habit Screen**: Full swipe back support
- **Edit Habit Screen**: Full swipe back support  
- **Today Screen**: Full swipe back support
- **Habit List Screen**: Not needed (root screen)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Gesture Detection Logic

1. **Touch Area**: Left 20dp of screen height
2. **Direction Check**: Only rightward (`dragAmount.x > 0`) swipes trigger
3. **Distance Threshold**: 30dp minimum drag distance
4. **Debouncing**: `swipeTriggered` flag prevents multiple calls per gesture

### Performance Considerations

- **Minimal Overhead**: Gesture detection only active when enabled
- **Efficient Area**: Small detection area (20dp width) minimizes performance impact
- **Native Integration**: Uses Compose's built-in gesture detection system

### Error Handling

- **Safe Navigation**: Integrates with existing `safeNavigateBack()` which includes:
  - Navigation state validation
  - Back stack existence check
  - Exception handling with logging
  - Debouncing for rapid navigation attempts

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Basic functionality tests in `SwipeBackHandlerTest.kt`:
- Callback mechanism validation
- Interface structure verification

### Manual Testing Requirements

Since gesture detection requires actual touch input, comprehensive testing should include:
- iOS Simulator testing with simulated gestures
- Physical iOS device testing
- Edge case testing (various swipe speeds, angles, distances)

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Enable SwipeBackHandler

✅ **Enable for:**
- Detail screens (edit/add forms)
- Secondary navigation screens
- Modal-like screens

❌ **Don't enable for:**
- Root/main screens
- Screens with conflicting gestures
- Screens requiring precise left-edge interactions

### Integration Best Practices

1. **Consistent Usage**: Apply to all secondary screens for consistent UX
2. **Proper Callback**: Always use `safeNavigateBack()` for navigation
3. **Conditional Enabling**: Consider disabling during form submission or loading states

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for a more native iOS experience:

1. **Visual Feedback**: Add visual indicators during swipe gesture
2. **Progressive Animation**: Show navigation animation progress during swipe
3. **Velocity-Based Completion**: Complete navigation based on swipe velocity
4. **Haptic Feedback**: Add iOS-appropriate haptic feedback during gestures

## Dependencies

- **Compose Multiplatform**: Core gesture detection
- **Navigation Compose**: Integration with navigation system  
- **Logger**: Debug logging for gesture events

## Compatibility

- **iOS Targets**: iosX64, iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64
- **Android**: Graceful fallback to system navigation
- **Minimum Requirements**: Standard Compose Multiplatform requirements
